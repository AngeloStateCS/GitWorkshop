which contains a couple Shell (Linux) scripts developed for 
personal use by Joel King in a couple classes at ASU. 

One script (irvine_test.sh) is designed to enable file input
piping for programs compiled from Assembly on the csunix box.
(Dr. Lopa may actually end up using this script in the near
future.)

The other script (compilerFastCheck.sh) is designed to help
do the heavy lifting in checking compiler output in CS4301
(the Algorithmic Languages and Compilers course).
