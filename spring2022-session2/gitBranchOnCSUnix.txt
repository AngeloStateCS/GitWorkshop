Edit the hidden file called .bashrc in your user directory. 
(Try not to edit/change too much in here. You can break your access to csunix and may need a ticket with IT to fix it.)

In .bashrc (the . at the start of the name makes the file invisible/hidden) you should see a line similar to:

PS1='\u@\h \w> '

This PS1 variable is what describes your command prompt on the csunix box. You can actually change this!

If you type a # in front of this line so it appears like so:

#PS1='\u@\h \w> '

It will comment out that line so it no longer works. Then put

PS1="\[\033[38;5;11m\]\u\[$(tput sgr0)\]@\h:\[$(tput bold)\][\w]\[$(tput sgr0)\]\[\033[38;5;14m\]\$(git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/')\[$(tput sgr0)\]>\[$(tput sgr0)\]"

On the line below that line. 

You'll now have a slightly more colorful command prompt that also will show what git branch you are on if you're in a directory that is a git repository!
